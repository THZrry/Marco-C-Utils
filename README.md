# Marco C Utils
**English** [简体中文](README_zh.md)
***
This is the current name.
I wanna use a light c vector, but my known existing libraries are too heavy for me, so I put this cvector with only marcos here. I may add morethings in the future.

# About RBTree
Who can help, please?
when it comes to inserting data with rotating, it crashes, with segmentation fault.
The code with a number of marcos is near unreadable, and I'm not able to solve.
